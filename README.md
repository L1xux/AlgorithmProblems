# Algorithm

> ## What is purpose?
> `Purpose` is studying a lot of algorithm problems in terms of dynamic programming, graph, tree etc. indeed, I wish this PS would be a good practice to get a job at the **great tech companies** that you wanna work in as well as becoming a better engineer than any others

<br />
<br />

> ## Prerequisite
> Actually, you don't need to prepare for specific things. because first, every programming languages is allowed here. you can solve a problem with a confident language. but when you review someone's code, you should read it at least. second, you can write a five steps in korean if you want. third, if you don't know how to use Markdown or git, let me give u links to learn them. [Markdown](https://heropy.blog/2017/09/30/markdown/) [git document](https://git-scm.com/book/ko/v2/%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0-%EB%B2%84%EC%A0%84-%EA%B4%80%EB%A6%AC%EB%9E%80?) (it's a korean version) (especially, you can learn git from 1 to 3 chapter.)

> ## How to study?
> ### how to place a folder or file?
> you should place the folder or file you create on the right page. 
> 1. The start page is any sites of algorithm problems. for example, it can be Leetcode, Baekjoon and Kickstart. also, it must be a folder (if a problem is just like in 2021 competition of Kickstart, it should be Kickstart/2021/~)
> 2. The middle page is the type of a problem and problem name. it also must be a folder. for example, if there is a problem called 'a1' which of typs is bfs on Leetcode. the path should be 'Leetcode/bfs/a1/~' 
> 3. The last page is about who you are. so its name must be your name. for example, it should be "Steven" in my case. besides, it's supposed to include your code and **five steps** files. therefore, it must be a folder as well. (**five steps** is explained below) for example, let's say "a problem called b1 which of type is dfs on Kickstart and your name is Steven", it should be placed in "Kickstart/dfs/b1/Steven"
>
>  ### how to review each other?
>  you basically review someone's code in their repo. for example, let's say Steven solved a problem called 'a1'. Sara wanna review his code. she goes to his repo 'Leetcode/dfs/a1/Steven' and make a review script named as Sara.md. after that, she commits it. (Btw, you can study how to use git in this page) 

>  **Here is steps for reviewer**  
>  1. you pick up anyone you want to review on someone's folder
>  2. Please including the explanation why your approach is better than owner's code in review file.
>  3. Push it

> ## Introduction of five steps
> You need to fill out a form called 'Five Steps' and solve the problem. this form is a plan about the overall process of solving a problem. i attach it on the first page. please copy it in your repo and fill out the form when you solve a problem

> 1. Understand
	=> you summarize the content of the problem and also should include constraints.
>
> 2. Redefine
> => you redefine the problem as your own language. for example, it would be a kind of mathematical or computational concepts. you can use concepts related to discrete mathematics
>
> 3. Plan
> => you choose a algorithm or structure in this step. and write down how to solve the problem. 
>
> 4. Verify 
> => you verify a strategy you build like analyzing the efficiency of the algorithm you chosen with big O notation. i recommend you to compare time complexity of the algorithm with the constraint of the problem.
>
> 5. Review
> => you can improve your code by reviewing your approach. find out a better way to solve the problem. for example, if i solve a problem with brute force, then you may say "Oh, i can use dynamic programming here because ~".
